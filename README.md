This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Added Notes

I attempted to build a simple contact form and a dashboard that could display all the info of the entries. 

This project was inspired by the contact form of wordpress. 
Wordpress comes with some plugins to help you build a contact form or subscribe form.
I run a few wordpress websites and notices that they get tons of spam. There is a fix for this using php, but I thought let me write it in Nextjs as a way to practice, a piece for my portfolio and posibly a way to make some extra money in the future
